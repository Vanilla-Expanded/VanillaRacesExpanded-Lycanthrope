		<description>A dubious xenogerm of debated origin, wolfmen/lycans have propagated unimpeded throughout colonized space to stake territorial claims and establish packs or larger clans. Their wolfman form has diminished nocturnal abilities, trading many advantages in exchange for being able to share their xenogerm with others.\n\nThere is no clear history established regarding the history of lycans, made especially murky as each new pack tends to fabricate their own origins. This has led to widely varying conspiracy theories, most of which at least partially involve sanguophages, especially due to similarities in their genes. The most prevalent one is that a sanguophage fell in love with an yttakin, later transforming them into one of their ilk, however there were complications as the newly-changed sanguophage was pregnant. The child was born but was abandoned by their parents, yet managed to survive living amongst stray dogs. Eventually they set out to make their own family, whether through blood or water, and to always consider that family comes first.</description>

		<description>A dubious xenogerm of debated origin, wolfmen/lycans have propagated unimpeded throughout colonized space to stake territorial claims and establish packs or larger clans. Their lycan form has nocturnal advantages, improved close combat effectiveness, supernatural speed and regeneration, and an invigorating howl that impedes speech which improves further as more pack members join in.\n\nThere is no clear history established regarding the history of lycans, made especially murky as each new pack tends to fabricate their own origins.
